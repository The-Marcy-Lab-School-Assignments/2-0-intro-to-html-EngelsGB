2/3. I would encourage you to be more descriptive and clear about exactly what the definition is. I know you know, but I want you to write more here and actually describe what this is. You can even give a code snippet example if that's easier! Like so:

```html
<!-- An example of the 'class' attribute-->
<h1 class="mainTitle">Engel's Webpage</h1>
```
